### Challenge:
    1. Use the following Wikipedia page and get the data from the “European Union Road Safety Facts and Figures” table: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_safety_in_Europe
    2. Resulting CSV file should only include the following columns: Country, Year, Area, Population, GDP per capita, Population density, Vehicle ownership, Total road deaths, Road deaths per Million Inhabitants.
        - Note that “Year” column value is always 2018.
    3. Data should be sorted by “Road deaths per Million Inhabitants” column.
    4. We want a script for this and we want this script to be in python or nodejs so that you can demonstrate your knowledge of the given programming languages.
        - Your git repo should include all dependencies in standard way so that it can be run in the CI/CD.
        - Please, use simple and built-in libraries where possible rather than use a framework.
